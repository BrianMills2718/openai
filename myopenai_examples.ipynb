It is measured by comparing its performance with a conventional navigation (C-N) system in a simulated surgical procedure on cadaver heads, and is controlled by randomizing the order of sides and order of navigation system employment for each specimen, standardizing surgical procedures, and using a dialog-based computer application to measure the surgeon's perceived workload and mental demand. The accuracy and clinical feasibility of the system is analyzed according to surgeons' years of experience and assessed through quantified scores in each subscale and overall score obtained through a program based on the NASA-TLX rating scale. The AR-N system outperformed the C-N system in all categories measured, and was further evaluated based on different navigational systems and display fusing real endoscopic images to 3-D virtual images in head phantom experiments.'\""
